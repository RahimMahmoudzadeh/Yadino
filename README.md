## 🏗 Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles to separate concerns and ensure testability:

1.  **UI Layer:** Built with Jetpack Compose, driven by ViewModels/Components.
2.  **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic and UseCases.
3.  **Data Layer:** Handles data sources (Room DB) and repositories.

Navigation is handled by **Decompose**, treating screens as components with their own lifecycles, making the app highly modular.
